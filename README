Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Summary

This is part of a Yocto compilation. To see the complete instructions, please refer to (REF_GIST)

Images
============

* core-image-v2x-dev::
This image contains all the necessary components to give 802.11p connectivity. Up until now, it is only provided a development
image, this means that Wireless-regdb and CRDA software have to be compiled in the host (Hummingboard2).
In the future, it will be provided the core-image-v2x image which will have solely the necessary components for having 802.11p 
connection without compiling those programs in the host.
